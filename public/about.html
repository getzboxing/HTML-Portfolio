<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Coach and former athletic competitor, I am committed to finding news way to
  interact with technology to improve and expand atletic performance.
</p>
<p>
  My concentration has been with combat sports, with a heavy concentration in
  boxing. I use the borrowed phrase to describe my goals:
  <b>'Improving the Sweet Science by eliminating the brutal physics'</b>
</p>

<p>
  I will offer what research has revealed about the impact combat sports have on society, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
  We will have a look at the moral principles that relate to boxing, and other
  combat sports, particularly as how they contribute to concussive injury and
  how that may be prevented.
